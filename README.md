# File Transfer Program

# Description

What?

A network file transfer program that works between two users on a local network.
This will be the source code for our project, which will be used in a separate GUI

How?

The user will run the program and detect the active devices on the network to determine who to send a certain file to. After entering a filepath, the recipient will have to accept the file. Once accepted, the file will be transfered to a receiving end user running the same program.

Why?

File tranfer is very imprtant in this day and age. Gaining the knowleadge nessesary to be able to do this on our own will be benificial in our careers as computer scientists. Since we did not learn about file transfer in class, this will be the perfect opportunity to do so.

# Deliverables

### GUI frontend:
- Select user on the network to send to
- Receiving user will see received files
- filepath line for file selection, ideally with browse button
### Program Backend:
- open port to receive or send files
- schedule to handle receiving and sending files, with send priority
### Documentation:
- Notes or a help file with more detailed information on what every feature does
  - How to display divices on the network
  - How to select/send a file
  - How to accept a file

# Plan

### Week 1:
- Investigate whether Server/Client or Peer to Peer is more reliable
- Create text based backend
- Design UI
### Week 2:
- study up on how file transfer works
-	using sudo code - create server/client connections
### Week 3:
- Work on creating the server
-	Basic work on the client
### Week 4:
- Work on creating the client 
-	Connect the clients to the server	
### Week 5:
- Flesh out the UI 
-	Fix any problems and/or outlier bugs

# Comments
1. Revise the description. Make sure that you answer the 3 questions What? Why? How? clearly. From reading your description, it is hard to understand the scenario that you are trying to accomplish (Resolved)
2. Be more specific about the deliverables. What will be in GUI frontend (features?)? What does the backend do (features)? (Resolved)
3. At this point you should have a rough idea about the plan of implementation. Make sure to add all 5 weeks in your plan. (Resolved)
4. ProgressUpdates.md is missing!
