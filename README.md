# File Transfer Program

# Description
A network file transfer program that works between two users on a local network.
This will be the source code for our project, which will be used in a separate GUI

How?

The user will be able to read the active devices on the network to determine who to send a certain file to. After entering a filepath, the file will be transfered to a receiving end program.
