					The Official Guide to the Buttons, Bells and Whistles!
Source IP Textbox - Automatically populates with the IP address of the user sending you a file as soon as they connect

Incoming File Name - Self explanatory, automatically populates with the name of the file being sent to you.

Deny/Accept File Buttons - These let the user decide whether to receive the file. Denying will close the socket, accepting will save it to the
			   working directory.

Available Users List - This list would contain all the IP addresses with this program's socket open, meaning they are ready to receive files.
		       It populates with the Scan button, which doesn't do much else.

Scan Button - Look up about 2 lines.

Destination IP Textbox - The user would manually enter the IP address from the list above that they would like to send the file to

Path and Name of file - The user enters the filepath of their file, copied and pasted from a file explorer, which tells the program which
  			file to send, as well as which file name to report to the other user in their Incoming File Name

Connect Button - This button connects this user to the other user, giving them this user's IP address as well as the name of the file you 
		 entered above. The red light also turns green when the other user accepts to show that the two users are connected.

Send Button - This button sends the file to the other user, then closes the socket, reopening the listening channel to receive files.
